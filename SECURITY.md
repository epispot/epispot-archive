## Reporting a Vulnerability

The epispot team works as hard as possible to keep code clear of any vulnerabilities. 
Our steps include extensive CodeQL analysis, third-party open-source code analysis from tools like codefactor.io, and heavy unit testing.
However, vulnerabilities will inevitably arise. If you see or suspect a vulnerability, epispot will fix it as fast as possible.

### Here's what to do if you've found a vulnerability:
1. Open an issue and **@mention** a maintainer
2. Title the issue "VULNERABILITY" but do not describe the vulnerability in the issue itself
3. You will receive further instructions after completing (2)
